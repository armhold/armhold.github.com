  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a few weeks now I&#8217;ve been plagued with timeouts while updating my App Engine apps. At first I thought it was a problem in the Intellij EAP beta I was running, but today I spent some time digging into it.</p>

<p>It seems to be unrelated to the EAP, as I get the same behavior with the App Engine command-line tools- timeout failure parsing web.xml roughly 75% of the time. It looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nov 17, 2010 4:32:54 PM com.google.apphosting.utils.config.AbstractConfigXmlReader readConfigXml

After some <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1235#c15">digging around</a>, it seems to be related to a timeout deep in the bowels of Java&#8217;s XML libs while trying to validate the DTD for web.xml.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fix is simple: elide the DTD declaration from the top of your web.xml:</p>

<blockquote><p>&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app    PUBLIC &#8220;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&#8221;    &#8221;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&#8221;></p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The predictive keyboard in <a href="http://www.quickbrownfrog.com/#typing:scottish_terrier.xml:0">QuickBrownFrog</a> has gone through three major iterations so far. At first, I really didn&#8217;t expect to be able to implement a functional keyboard in GWT (i.e. Javascript+CSS), so I set about drawing the keyboard using Omnigraffle.</p>

<h3>Round 1 - Static Images</h3>

<p><a href="/images/2010/11/h.png"><img src="/images/2010/11/h.png" alt="static keyboard image from Omnigraffle" /></a></p>

<p>It was fairly easy to whip up the initial design. But then in order to implement key selection I had to create about 100 variations of this with all the different keys selected. That was painful.</p>

<p>GWT provides a way to <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiImageBundles.html">bundle image resources</a>, and that helped keep the image size in check, but it was still a bit slow on the client until all the images were cached. Unfortunately this also meant that I had to create a mongo ImageResources.java interface, which listed every foo_key() foo_keyShifted(), etc.</p>

<p>So this clearly wasn&#8217;t optimal, but it worked for a while. Then when I decided it was time to change the &#8220;selected&#8221; color, and I had to manually re-color every single PNG. Obviously, this was not going to scale, and it was time to re-think my approach. So I set about experimenting with ways to programmatically generate the keyboard.</p>

<h3>Round 2 - SVG</h3>

<p>First up, I went with SVG. The SVG Canvas is not natively supported in every browser, but the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-graphics/">GWT-Graphics library</a> gracefully uses VML in Internet Explorer, making it effectively cross-platform. This worked pretty well, and after a day and a half tweaking the layout, I had a functional SVG keyboard. And finally I was able to change the look of the keys (color, shape, etc) very easily with a couple lines of code. I was thrilled!</p>

<p>Unfortunately VML on IE was still kind of slow, and also had some occasional rendering problems. Still, this was far better than a huge set of static images, so I stuck with SVG for a while. When it came time to re-design the website with a new color scheme I was really thrilled to not have to update 100+ keyboard images in Omnigraffle again.!</p>

<p>Round 3 - CSS</p>

<p>With launch-time approaching, the speed issues with VML have really started to become a problem. Clearly, a <em>predictive</em> keyboard needs to be faster than the typist using it, and my keyboard was not keeping up. That led me to my third iteration- CSS.</p>

<p>Since my SVGKeyboard.java was created as an <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/index.html?overview-summary.html">AbsolutePanel</a> subclass, it was fairly straightforward to re-implement it in regular old GWT. Instead of an SVG rect, each key is now simply an AbsolutePanel, with <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/index.html?overview-summary.html">InlineLabels</a> for keycaps.</p>

<p>Implementing the &#8220;selected&#8221; coloring is as simple as adding and removing a CSS style that specifies the color and background-color. I was even able to make the keys look rounded with the following bit of CSS magic:</p>

<pre><code>-moz-border-radius: 4px;
 border-radius: 4px;
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s perhaps not as pretty as my original Omnigraffle drawing, but that seems a small sacrifice to make for ease of maintenance, should I decide to tweak the design in the future. Plus there&#8217;s the performance improvement- typing really flies now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a new consumer-oriented webapp for touch-typing lessons. I&#8217;ve been very much inspired by
<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick McKenzie</a> of <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/">Bingo Card Creator</a> fame, so you
 will find some obvious similarities between our approaches and target audience. This blog will document both the
 technical and business aspects of bringing Quick Brown Frog to market.</p>

<h2>So, why typing software?</h2>

<p>Typing software has been around forever, and there are some excellent, well-known packages for learning how to type.
But most of them are shrink-wrap products that you have to physically purchase and install from CD. The idea that you
need to have a round piece of plastic shipped to your home in order to install a piece of software is really an
anachronism in 2010.</p>

<p>Yes, there are some decent typing tutors on the web, but the ones that actually work half-decently are Flash or Java
apps. I think I can do something in the modern browser, and without resorting to any plugins.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Additionally, once I&#8217;ve had a chance to go back and clean up and refactor my code, I hope to take the nuts-and-bolts
scaffolding from my app and turn <em>that</em> into a product- a quick-starter way to create all the common things a
consumer-oriented webapps needs, such as account creation, secure password hashing, &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; links,
expiring downloads, etc.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more news on that front, as well as some &#8220;how it&#8217;s built&#8221; type posts.</p>

<h2>Quick Brown&#8230; Frog?</h2>

<p>&#8220;Quick Brown Fox&#8221; was the obvious choice, but alas, there&#8217;s already an (iPhone) app by that name.
<a href="http://QuickBrownFrog.appspot.com">QuickBrownFrog.com</a> was unique and available, so there it is! It&#8217;s still
quite heavily under construction, but feel free to visit and leave me some (much appreciated) feedback.</p>
