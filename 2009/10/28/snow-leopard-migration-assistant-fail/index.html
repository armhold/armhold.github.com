<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2009/10/macpro.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using a Mac almost exclusively since about 2006. Unsurprisingly, I have quite a lot of data on my system, and on its Time Machine backups. Until recently I have been quite impressed with Apple&#8217;s Migration Assistant- the tool that (used to!) seamlessly migrate your apps and data from an old machine to a new one. It&#8217;s one of those things that us smug Mac users brag about to our PC-using friends. Recently however, I&#8217;ve been disappointed by it.</p>

<p>First, my wife got a new MBPro from her job, which replaced her 3 year old MBPro. I told her the migration would be a piece of cake. I expected to do the usual trick where you boot the old machine into Firewire Target Mode, and the new machine sees the old one as a Firewire volume. No such luck- Apple changed the Firewire port on the newer MBPro, so she had to make a trip down to the Apple Store to get a new cable. Turns out they sold her the wrong one, so at this point I opted for doing the migration using our WiFi. Despite entering all the appropriate network configuration, the two computers couldn&#8217;t talk to each other.</p>

<p>So I ran a Cat5 cable between the two machines. I was able to connect this time, but I kept getting thrown into an endless loop where you are prompted to enter a PIN to give the new computer access to the old one- it would connect for an instant, and then loop back to the beginning all over again.</p>

<p>Wife, sensing my frustration level, decided to bring it into her office and have the IT guys deal with it. They had the appropriate Firewire cable and did the transfer without a hitch.</p>

<p>So fast forward to me getting a new job, and the requisite new toy: a totally decked-out quad-core MacPro with all the bells and whistles. Time to migrate from my old MBPro to this new tower. I&#8217;m about 4 hours into the transfer using Migration Assistant (we have the right cable now!) and it&#8217;s still telling me that there are 10+ hours left in the transfer. This doesn&#8217;t look good. So I pop open the Console tool, and lo and behold, I see that MigrateTool has in fact crashed, <strong>despite the lack of any error messages on the screen.</strong> I quit Migration Assistant, and start over. Same deal.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2009/10/migrationassistant.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So I try erasing the Mac Pro&#8217;s HD and starting with a fresh OS install from DVD. Migration Assistant <strong>still</strong> silently crashes.</p>

<p>So I try doing a migration from my Time Machine volume as the source volume in Migration Assistant. Same deal. So I try doing a &#8220;manual&#8221; installation using Time Machine. A few hours in, I finally get a somewhat helpful error message indicating that it cannot continue because <strong>the source volume is case-sensitive, the target volume is case-insensitive</strong>, and there is a pair of conflicting files on the source drive &#8220;3.3.1.ga&#8221; and &#8220;3.3.1.GA&#8221; (Hibernate, my favorite!)</p>

<p>This is not totally surprising, and is what I suspected might be the problem- back in 2006 I had made the poor decision to install my MBPro as case-sensitive, since that&#8217;s what most Unixes use. That&#8217;s finally come back to bite me. Anyway, I remove the duplicate file from the source machine, and carry on. Several hours later, Migration Assistant crashes again. And since it doesn&#8217;t print any helpful error message, I can&#8217;t locate what is likely another duplicate file. Ugh!</p>

<p>Obviously one solution might be to re-install the machine as case-sensitive, but I don&#8217;t want to go through this kind of hell again during some future migration; I&#8217;d rather pay the piper now and be done with it. I have a call into Apple Tech Support (you get 90 days free support on any new machine, even without Apple Care.. did you know that?) I will update as things progress. Any suggestions for solving this are greatly welcome.</p>
