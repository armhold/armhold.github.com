<p>Like any Apple fan, I want to run out and buy an iPad today. I&#8217;ve wanted an eReader for quite some time now, and have been dragging my feet on getting a Kindle only because I wanted to see if Apple could produce something better. Notwithstanding the current lack of reviews of its text quality, the iPad certainly seems to be the more compelling device.</p>

<p>But there is a serious question you should ask yourself before taking the plunge. How would you feel if someone took your current computer (laptop, desktop- whatever it is you use on a daily basis) and told you that you could only install software on it that the manufacturer authorized? Do you currently check with Dell to see if it&#8217;s OK to install Photoshop or Chrome on your machine? With the iPad, that will be your Brave New World. Want to install the latest beta of your favorite program? Well, <strong>unless Apple makes radical changes to the App Store, you won&#8217;t be able to do that</strong>.</p>

<p>As an iPhone user, I was willing to make <em>some</em> concessions to Apple regarding what apps could and could not do on the device. It is after all a phone, and I want my phone to work when I use it. I don&#8217;t want the battery to die unexpectedly because some app was running in the background, or to lose my data because another app decided to scribble all over the file system. A phone is an appliance, and by and large you want an appliance to behave predictably and reliably.</p>

<p>But a tablet computer isn&#8217;t quite the same thing. It sits vaguely between &#8220;ebook reader&#8221; and &#8220;laptop computer&#8221;. As time goes on, I expect that laptops in general will start to look more and more like tablets. As Jobs said,</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;Browsing, Email, Photos, Video, Music, Games, eBooks&#8230; if there&#8217;s gonna be a third category of device, it&#8217;s gonna have to be better at these kinds of tasks than a laptop or a smartphone, otherwise it has no reason for being.&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Right now you might use the iPad to read the New York Times while waiting for your bus, or to check your email while sitting in a caf√©. But will you eventually use it for actual work? If the technology gets good enough, will you leave your laptop behind and starting using your tablet for everything? <strong>Once you really come to rely on it for your work, will you still be comfortable with Apple exerting total control over every piece of software you install on it?</strong></p>

<p>Did you notice during the demo that when Steve Jobs went to the NY Times website, there were lots of &#8220;missing plugin&#8221; icons where the Flash ads should have been? At first I thought this was just an embarrassing mistake in delivery, but the more I think about it, the more I&#8217;ve come to believe that this was entirely intentional- <strong>a message to the NY Times directly from Mr Jobs, saying that their website will look like crap on the device until they dump Flash</strong>.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/11/adobe-flash-on/">antipathy towards Flash</a>, and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1012-5181434.html">Adobe in general</a>, is nothing new. And as much as I would love to see Flash banished from the web, this kind of complete control by Apple really worries me. Don&#8217;t get me wrong- I really want one of these devices. But I&#8217;m not so sure I&#8217;m ready to give up that much control to Apple just yet.</p>
