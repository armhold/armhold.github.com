The folks at [42lines](https://www.42lines.net/) have released an awesome [Firefox plugin](https://www.42lines.net/2012/01/31/announcing-wicket-source/) called "Wicket-Source". It allows you to easily navigate from your browser to the corresponding Wicket source code.

Since their plugin is Eclipse-based, I wrote up a compatible plugin for Intellij IDEA. You can install it from [the repository](http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?idea&id=6846), or build it yourself from the [source on Github](https://github.com/armhold/wicket-source-intellij).

There are two parts to this plugin: the Firefox extension (provided by 42lines) and the IDE plugin; you need both. To install the Firefox plugin, follow the [directions from 42lines](https://github.com/42Lines/wicket-source/wiki). Then to install the Intellij plugin do the following:



	
  1. Open the Preferences dialog (Intellij IDEA menu -> Preferences)

	
  2. Under "IDE Settings" select "Plugins"

	
  3. Click the "Browse Repositories" button.

	
  4. In the search box type "wicket", which should narrow the results significantly.

	
  5. Right-click "Wicket Source", and select "Download and Install".




You'll be asked to re-start Intellij, and then you should be in business. The plugin uses port Â 9123 and no password by default (same as the Firefox plugin defaults). To change this, open the IDE Settings dialog and click "Wicket Source" to enter a password.










Enjoy!
