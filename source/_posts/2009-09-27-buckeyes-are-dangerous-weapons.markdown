I moved to Cleveland recently. Today I encountered my first Buckeye while walking my dog. After it narrowly missed beaming me in the head, it still managed to draw blood when I picked it up and stuck myself on one of its thorns.







Once safely disarmed, the inside appears quite edible. I took it home and was planning to eat it, until I read they were poisonous. How is this thing _not_ a weapon?
