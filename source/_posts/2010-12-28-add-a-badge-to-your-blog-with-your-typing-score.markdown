Did you get an awesome word-per-minute score on your Quick Brown Frog typing speed test? Well now you can share it with the world by posting a Quick Brown Frog badge on your blog or website:
[![](/images/2010/12/typing-badge.png)](http://quickbrownfrog.com#!practice:)

We just added a [new feature](http://quickbrownfrog.com#!practice:) to all our typing practice sessions- at the end of the lesson you'll be shown the badge and the HTML code that generates it. Simply copy and paste the blue HTML code into your blog or website to add the badge for all to see.
