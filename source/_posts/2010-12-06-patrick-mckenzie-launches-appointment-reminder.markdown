Patrick McKenzie, a solo entrepreneur whom I admire greatly has launched his second project: [Appointment Reminder](https://www.appointmentreminder.org/).

Appointment Reminder is a service for personal business services (think: hair salons, medical offices, law firms, or anyone that regularly schedules appointments with clients). Appointment Reminder sends out reminders to clients automatically, via phone, SMS or email. Fewer forgotten appointments = increased revenue.

He's leveraging [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/), and API that I'm just dying to find an excuse to use.

Congrats Patrick, and good luck!
