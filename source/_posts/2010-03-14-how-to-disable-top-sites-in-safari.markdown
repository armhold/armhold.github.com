Although it might be pretty eye-candy, I do not find the Top Sites feature in Safari4 to be terribly useful for anything. You open a new tab or window, and Safari sits there spinning while loading a bunch of web sites you may or may not be interested in going to. I find Safari to be a whole lot faster with the feature turned off.

It's simple. Â Open Preferences, and tweak the settings for "New windows open with" and "New tabs open with" to be either an **Empty Page**, or whatever **Home Page** you prefer.
