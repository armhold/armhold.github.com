No, that's not my revenue (I wish!)

It's what [SLOCCount](http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/) estimates Quick Brown Frog cost to develop. I've always felt that SLOCCount tends to exaggerate development cost. Either that or I'm vastly underpaid.

7.6 months and $210K seems way high for this app, even with the salary is set to a rather low $56K default.

Still, it's quite the ego boost for a solo programmer. I've only been developing this [typing tutor](http://www.quickbrownfrog.com) for about 6 weeks so far, and this feels kind of like a pat on the back.

    
    SLOC	Directory	SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)

    Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
    java:          7067 (100.00%)
    
    Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 7,067
    Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 1.56 (18.70)
     (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
    Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.63 (7.61)
     (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
    Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 2.46
    Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 210,542
     (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).

This also goes to show that the _cost_ of software development does not necessarily have anything at all to do with its_ worth_.
