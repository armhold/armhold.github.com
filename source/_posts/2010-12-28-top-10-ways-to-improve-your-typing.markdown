Everyone loves top-10 lists, so here's the [Quick Brown Frog](http://quickbrownfrog.com) list of **Top-10 Ways to Improve Your Typing**.


## 1. Slow Down


This may seem counter-intuitive, but most new typists need to actually _slow down_ in order to see an improvement in their typing skills. Your Words-Per-Minute score also takes into account the number of typos and corrections you make. A slower speed tends to lead to fewer typos, and an overall _increase_ in typing speed.


## 2. Pretend you don't have a backspace key


In the bad old days of manual typewriters there was no such thing as backspacing to correct a typo; you had to apply some white-out or else start over from scratch. Some typists have become overly dependent upon their backspace key. If you find yourself making lots of mistakes, pretend that you don't have a backspace key, and that every character you type must be perfect. This may slow you down in the short-term, but it will pay dividends as you better learn the keyboard.


## 3. Unlearn Bad Habits


Most people learn to type in a very ad-hoc manner. Often we learn the location of the keys through hunt-and-peck, rather than deliberately practicing proper typing technique. This also means typing keys with the wrong fingers. When these habits are learned early, they're very hard to break. Make a concentrated effort to use the proper fingering and position for each key-press.


## 4. Use Both Shift Keys


Every keyboard comes with two shift keys for a good reason- certain key combinations are meant to be typed _with two hands. _This is something that even experienced typists often get wrong. It's **not** OK to use only the left or right shift key for all your typing!

Our [typing lessons](http://quickbrownfrog#!lessons:) clearly explain which shift key to use with each letter or symbol. As each key is introduced, its corresponding shift key is also given. Generally speaking, if the key is on the _left_ side of the keyboard you should use the _right_ shift key with it, and vice-versa.


## 5. Practice on Unfamiliar Text


If you're trying to break some old habits, typing commonly-used words and phrases may actually be counter-productive, since you'll just be reinforcing your improper technique. Muscle memory tends to take over when typing familiar things such as your email address, or web site URLs that you commonly use.

Instead, try typing unfamiliar text so that muscle memory doesn't get in the way of unlearning your old technique. Quick Brown Frog offers a [huge selection of practice text](http://quickbrownfrog.com#!practice:) with new content added every week. You can also practice with unfamiliar content by using our [random words](http://quickbrownfrog.com#!practice:) feature.


## 6. Use the Home Row


There's a reason that the [Home Row](http://www.quickbrownfrog.com/#!typing:lesson:lesson001:0) is the very first lesson taught by every typing course- it forms the basis of proper finger placement, and allows you to easily reach all the keys of the keyboard.

Always start with your fingers above the Home Row- **asdf** for the left hand, and **jkl;** for the right. Always return your fingers to this position after typing keys on the other rows.


## 7. Strive for Economy of Movement


"Economy of movement" is a fancy way of saying "try to move your hands as little as possible". If you're a "two finger typist", chances are you're having to move your hands all over the place to reach the keys.

The idea with economy of movement is that you want to make use of _all of your fingers_, and _both hands_, rather than favoring your "strong" fingers (typically your index and middle fingers).

It's no coincidence that this is the exact same concept that musicians use when learning their instruments.


## 8. Relax and Stretch


Like any physical activity, typing requires you to use your muscles. Your muscles work their best when you're relaxed. Take breaks frequently, and [stretch your muscles](http://exercise.about.com/od/flexibilityworkouts/tp/officestretches.htm).


## 9. Watch the screen, not the keyboard


Many new typists spend way too much time looking at the keyboard rather than the screen. In addition to slowing down your learning the location of the keys, this habit encourages bad posture, as your head is constantly tilting up and down to go from the screen to the keyboard.

Instead, watch the screen to see what you're typing. That might mean that you have to slow down your typing initially until you learn all the keys, but it will pay dividends in the long run.


## 10. Practice daily


Like any skill, developing good typing ability requires a certain amount of dedication and practice. As with practicing a musical instrument, short-but-daily sessions are better than long marathon sessions done infrequently. Try to set aside a certain amount of time each day to spend practicing with Quick Brown Frog, and you'll be a typing expert in no time!
