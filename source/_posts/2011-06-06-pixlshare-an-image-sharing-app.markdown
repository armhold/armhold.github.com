[Pixlshare](http://pixlshare.com/) is a new image-sharing webapp that I just started working on. It's intended to be a low-friction way to do simple image sharing- upload an image and instantly get a URL that you can share with others. No accounts or logins needed- just click upload and you're done.

It's built in Wicket and tiny bit of JQuery. It's fairly basic, but it has one fairly novel feature- you can add textual annotations to your uploaded images; the annotations appear as actual searchable text, rather than merely being part of the image bits.

I'm planning to add features like:



	
  * HTML5 drag-n-drop for uploads

	
  * upload multiple pictures at once to create an album

	
  * user comments
