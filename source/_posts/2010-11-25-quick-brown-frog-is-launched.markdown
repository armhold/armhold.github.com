After lots of helpful feedback from beta testers and Hacker News, my [typing tutor](http://www.quickbrownfrog.com) app "Quick Brown Frog" is live and open for business!

Some of the things I changed in response to feedback include:



	
  * [price reduction](http://www.quickbrownfrog.com/#!store:) from $29.95 -> $9.95

	
  * support both Google Checkout and Paypal options for payment

	
  * [stats reporting](http://www.quickbrownfrog.com/#!progress:) (WPM/Accuracy improvement over time)

	
  * report on frequently mis-typed keys after practice lessons

	
  * allow automatic single/double spacing after end of sentences (_very_ frequently requested)

	
  * implemented crawlable Ajax links for SEO

	
  * plus many bug fixes for cross-browser compatibility


I consider this an [MVP-level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) release, which means that it still needs lots of work and polish (in particular, the look-and-feel of the UI).

The important thing is to get it out there, and start getting feedback from actual customers. Absent that, I'd just be spinning my wheels.
