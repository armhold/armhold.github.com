In order to dive into Ruby, I decided to convert [Pixlshare](http://pixlshare.com) from Java+Wicket to Ruby on Rails.

It's an admittedly small project, but I was surprised how easy it was. I had it basically working in under a day, and
polished enough for production use in under 2 days.

But the best part was the code size: a reduction of **6 to 1** going from Java -> Ruby.
