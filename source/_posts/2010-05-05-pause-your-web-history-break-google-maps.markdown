For a few days [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) stopped working for me. I first noticed it while trying to get directions to the airport. I use Safari, and the Maps page would just sit there with "Still loading..." forever. I thought it was a momentary glitch, but 2 days later it was still happening. I fired up Chrome on the same machine, which worked fine. Back in Safari, I tried clearing the cache, restarting the browser, etc. all to no avail.

Today I figured it out- I had paused my [web history](https://www.google.com/history/) some time back. On a whim I tried unpausing it, and lo and behold, Maps now works again in Safari. Pausing it again results in the same breakage, so the problem is repeatable.Â Having to enable Web History to use Maps is a little unsettling, but this sounds like a bug.
