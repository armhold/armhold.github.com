This is great news: [Intellij IDEA Open-Sourced](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/10/intellij-idea-open-sourced/). If you're an Eclipse or Netbeans user you owe it to yourself to try out Intellij, especially now that it's free. Yes, there are some features that are not included in the free edition, such as Google App Engine or GWT support. But I really hope this encourages more devs to check it out.
