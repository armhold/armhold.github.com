We've been busy adding new features over the Christmas holidays. The first of these is already available for you to use: you can now create a practice typing session from a set of [random English words](http://www.quickbrownfrog.com/#!practice:):

We've had numerous requests from users for a feature that would generate random typing lessons based on actual words. You can now generate instant typing practices, simply by choosing the number of words you wish to type.

We're planning to extend this feature in the future to create automatically create lessons targeting letters that you need to practice (the ones you make the most typos with).

Enjoy!
